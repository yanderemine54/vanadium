# Vanadium: A functional programming languages that doesn't get in your way

## Philosophy

I created vanadium because I found that functional programming languages make for very elegant code, but their stubbornness with pure functions made me very frustrated while using them.

A function declaration may look very weird to you, but it is actually very straightforward: it's just a variable!
